if u want to stop this server enter the command ==>shutdown.bat


enter the url on browser 
===============================
http://localhost:8080/DOC_DIR/

http://192.168.36.26:8080/DOC_DIR/
===============================

---------------------------------------------
important note : 
changes u need to do in server.xml
 <Connector port="8080" address="192.168.36.26" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443"
               maxParameterCount="1000"
               />
------------------------------------------


Example Batch Script for Windows:

REM Navigate to the directory containing the batch file
cd /d %~dp0

REM Change to the project directory

Role of Apache Tomcat
Apache Tomcat is a web server and servlet container that allows you to host web applications. Here’s why you use it:

========================
Hosting the Application:
========================

Tomcat serves your web application, making it accessible over a network.
Your application files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are hosted on the server.
Processing Requests:

Tomcat handles HTTP requests and responses, serving your web application to clients (like a web browser on your Android TV).
Dynamic Content:

If your application includes servlets or JSP (JavaServer Pages), Tomcat processes these to generate dynamic content.
Role of Fully Kiosk Browser on Android TV
Fully Kiosk Browser is an Android app that provides a full-screen, customizable browser experience specifically designed for kiosk and digital signage purposes. Here’s why you use it:

===========================
Displaying the Application:
===========================

Fully Kiosk Browser is used to display the web application hosted on Tomcat in a full-screen, immersive mode.
It hides the URL bar and navigation controls, providing a clean display without distractions.
Autostart on Boot:

It can be configured to start automatically when the TV boots, ensuring your application is displayed immediately without manual intervention.
Kiosk Features:

Prevents users from switching apps or navigating away, maintaining the focus on your web application.
Keeps the screen on and prevents the TV from going to sleep, which is ideal for continuous display.
How They Work Together
Development and Hosting:

You develop your web application and deploy it to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat makes your application accessible via a URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/DOC_DIR/).
Accessing the Application:

On your Android TV, you use Fully Kiosk Browser to access the URL of your hosted application.
Fully Kiosk Browser loads the web application from Tomcat and displays it in a user-friendly, full-screen mode.
Seamless User Experience:

When the Android TV is turned on, Fully Kiosk Browser automatically starts and loads your web application, providing a seamless experience.
Step-by-Step Usage
Deploy Web Application to Tomcat:

Place your WAR file in the webapps directory of Tomcat.
Start Tomcat to deploy your application.
Configure Fully Kiosk Browser on Android TV:

Install Fully Kiosk Browser from the Google Play Store.
Enter the URL of your web application hosted on Tomcat (http://localhost:8080/DOC_DIR/).
Configure kiosk settings to hide the URL bar, keep the screen on, and autostart on boot.
Startup Configuration:

Ensure Fully Kiosk Browser is set to launch on boot.
Reboot your Android TV to verify the setup.

Kiosk Browser:
==============

login the routers admin panel  
port forwarding system         
remote desktop
Network Attached Storage

Steps to Configure Port Forwarding
1. Determine Your Local Server's IP Address
First, you need to find the local IP address of the computer where Tomcat is running.

Windows: Open Command Prompt and type ipconfig. Look for the IPv4 Address under your active network connection.

==========================================
2. Log In to Your Router’s Admin Panel
==========================================
Access your router’s admin panel through a web browser.

Open a web browser on a device connected to your network.
Enter the router's IP address in the address bar. Common addresses are 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, or 192.168.1.254.
Log in with the router's admin username and password. These are usually found on a sticker on the router or in the router's manual.

==========================================
3. Set Up Port Forwarding
==========================================
Find the Port Forwarding Section:

The location of the port forwarding settings varies by router brand. Look for sections like Port Forwarding, Applications & Gaming, NAT/QoS, or Advanced Settings.

==========================================
Create a New Port Forwarding Rule:
==========================================

Add a new port forwarding rule with the following details:
Service Name: Give it a name (e.g., Tomcat).
Port Range: Enter 8080 for both the start and end ports.
Local IP: Enter the local IP address of the server running Tomcat (e.g., 192.168.1.100).
Local Port: Enter 8080.
Protocol: Choose TCP or Both.
Save/Apply the settings.
==========================================
4. Find Your Public IP Address
==========================================
Your public IP address is what devices outside your network will use to access your server.

Open a web browser.
Go to a website like https://www.whatismyip.com/ or https://www.ipchicken.com/.
Note down your public IP address.

==========================================
5. Update the URL on Fully Kiosk Browser
==========================================
Install and Open Fully Kiosk Browser on your Android TV.

==========================================
Enter the URL of Your Web Application:
==========================================

Use the public IP address and port 8080 in the URL format: http://your-public-ip:8080/DOC_DIR.
For example, if your public IP is 203.0.113.45, the URL would be http://203.0.113.45:8080/DOC_DIR.
Access Settings in Fully Kiosk Browser:

Enable options like Hide URL Bar, Hide Navigation Bar, Autostart Fully on Boot, and Prevent App Switch.
Save and Exit the settings.

====================
Important Notes :
====================
Ensure Your Local Server Is Always On: Your local server (desktop running Tomcat) must be on and connected to the network for your application to be accessible.
Static Local IP: It’s recommended to assign a static local IP to your server to prevent IP address changes.
Firewall Settings: Ensure that your local server’s firewall allows incoming connections on port 8080.
